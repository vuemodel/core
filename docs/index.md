  - title: Fast As F$%k To Bulid
    icon: 💪
    details: There are some nice APIs out there, but none as tightly integrated with Vue as VueModel. Every composable has been meticulously crafted to make working with VUE backends bliss.
  - title: Follows the LSD Standard
    icon: 📜
    details: The LSD standard is a highly opinionated way of coding. It gets your team on the same page, makes it easy to extract logic, and reduces cognitive overhead.
  - title: Highly Opinionated
    icon: 👍
    details: Opinionated and predictable. You could be using two totally different backends yet in Vue, it'll all feel the same.
  - title: Prototype Without A Backend
    icon: 🍀
    details: The "Local Storage" implementation is fully featured! That means you can prototype an entire application without building a backend. Clients can see what you'll build them before you write a single line of backend code AND they can play with it!
